# Configuration Overview

Welcome to the central hub of configurations for our system. This guide will walk you through each category, highlighting their significance and directing you to dedicated documentation for detailed insights.

## `Config` Class

The `Config` class serves as the backbone, ensuring that the system's settings are in harmony. It's designed to manage a plethora of configurations that dictate how the system behaves.

ðŸ“– Dive deeper into its inner workings with the [**Config Class Documentation**](ConfigClass.md).

---

## General Settings

Within the `settings` folder, you'll find an assortment of configurations that set the general tone and behavior of the system. These settings play a foundational role, establishing the baseline for the system's operations.

ðŸ“– Explore the intricacies with the [**Settings Documentation**](Configurations.md).

## Agent Configuration

Agents are the system's operatives, each having a distinct role. Their behaviors, interactions, and capabilities are defined by specific configurations, ensuring they act in accordance with their designated tasks.

ðŸ“– Learn more about building your own agent prompts in the [**Agent Prompts Documentation**](Agents/Prompts/AgentPrompts.md).

## Personas

Personas add flair and character to the system. They dictate how the system interacts, bringing a touch of personality and making engagements more relatable.

ðŸ“– Discover the art of crafting personas in the [**Personas Documentation**](Personas/Personas.md).

> **Important Note:** The magic of personas is still in the making, and documentation will be available once implemented.

## Tools

Tools are the system's utility belt. They comprise a set of functionalities that enhance the system's capabilities, allowing it to perform a variety of tasks efficiently.

ðŸ“– Delve into the toolbox with the [**Tools Documentation**](Tools/Tools.md).

---

## Actions

Actions represent a choreographed sequence of tools, each executed in succession to fulfill a specific task. Picture them as a roadmap, guiding the system on how to weave various tools together to reach its desired goals effectively.

ðŸ“– Discover the art of combining tools in our [**Actions Documentation**](Actions/Actions.md).

## Overriding Default LLM Settings on Agents

Flexibility is key. While there's a default setting for the LLMs, agents have the autonomy to deviate if needed. This ensures they can function optimally, especially when unique requirements arise.

ðŸ“– Get acquainted with the nuances of overriding in the [**Overriding Default Configurations Documentation**](Overrides/OverridingConfig.md).
