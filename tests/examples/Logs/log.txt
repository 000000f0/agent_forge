2023-06-19 22:37:58 - TASK RESULT:
Here is a draft program for an AI to perform web searches:

```python
# Define search scope and requirements
search_scope = {
    'search_engine': 'Google',  # Default search engine
    'safe_search': 'moderate', # Filter explicit results
    'language': 'en',          # Search in English
    'region': 'US'             # Focus on US results  
}

# Get search query from user 
search_query = input('Enter your search query: ')

# Construct search URL with query and scope parameters
search_url = f'https://{search_scope["search_engine"]}.com/search?q={search_query}'
for key, value in search_scope.items():
    search_url += f'&{key}={value}'

# Perform search and extract results
search_response = requests.get(search_url)
search_results = parse_search_response(search_response.text)

# Display results to user
for result in search_results:
    print(result['title'])
    print(result['link'])
    print()

# Get user feedback 
user_feedback = input('How can I improve the search results? ')

# Update search scope based on feedback
if 'safe_search' in user_feedback:
    search_scope['safe_search'] = user_feedback.split('=')[1] 
# ...

# Loop and continue improving search 
```

This program defines the scope and requirements for a basic web search tool. It takes a search query from the user, constructs a search URL based on the defined scope, performs the search, extracts the results, and displays them to the user. It also collects feedback from the user to improve the search scope and results for the next iteration. Please let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of this program.
